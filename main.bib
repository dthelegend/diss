              We demonstrate a direct mapping of max
              k
              -SAT problems (and weighted max
              k
              -SAT) to a Chimera graph, which is the non-planar hardware graph of the devices built by D-Wave Systems Inc. We further show that this mapping can be used to map a similar class of maximum satisfiability problems where the clauses are replaced by parity checks over potentially large numbers of bits. The latter is of specific interest for applications in decoding for communication. We discuss an example in which the decoding of a turbo code, which has been demonstrated to perform near the Shannon limit, can be mapped to a Chimera graph. The weighted max
              k
              -SAT problem is the most general class of satisfiability problems, so our result effectively demonstrates how any satisfiability problem may be directly mapped to a Chimera graph. Our methods faithfully reproduce the low energy spectrum of the target problems, so therefore may also be used for maximum entropy inference.},

	abstract = {One of the most important questions in studying quantum computation is: whether a quantum computer can solve NP-complete problems more efficiently than a classical computer? In 2000, Farhi, et al. (Science, 292(5516):472--476, 2001) proposed the adiabatic quantum optimization (AQO), a paradigm that directly attacks NP-hard optimization problems. How powerful is AQO? Early on, van Dam and Vazirani claimed that AQO failed (i.e. would take exponential time) for a family of 3SAT instances they constructed. More recently, Altshuler, et al. (Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 107(28): 12446--12450, 2010) claimed that AQO failed also for random instances of the NP-complete Exact Cover problem. In this paper, we make clear that all these negative results are only for a specific AQO algorithm. We do so by demonstrating different AQO algorithms for the same problem for which their arguments no longer hold. Whether AQO fails or succeeds for solving the NP-complete problems (either the worst case or the average case) requires further investigation. Our AQO algorithms for Exact Cover and 3SAT are based on the polynomial reductions to the NP-complete Maximum-weight Independent Set (MIS) problem.},

	abstract = {Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) is a combinatorial optimization to find an optimal binary solution vector that minimizes the energy value defined by a quadratic formula of binary variables in the vector. As many NP-hard problems can be reduced to QUBO problems, considerable research has gone into developing QUBO solvers running on various computing platforms such as quantum devices, ASICs, FPGAs, GPUs, and optical fibers. This paper presents a framework called Diverse Adaptive Bulk Search (DABS), which has the potential to find optimal solutions of many types of QUBO problems. Our DABS solver employs a genetic algorithm-based search algorithm featuring three diverse strategies: multiple search algorithms, multiple genetic operations, and multiple solution pools. During the execution of the solver, search algorithms and genetic operations that succeeded in finding good solutions are automatically selected to obtain better solutions. Moreover, search algorithms traverse between different solution pools to find good solutions. We have implemented our DABS solver to run on multiple GPUs. Experimental evaluations using eight NVIDIA A100 GPUs confirm that our DABS solver succeeds in finding optimal or potentially optimal solutions for three types of QUBO problems.},
